# Moja Global Project: High-Throughput Visualization Pipeline

Welcome to the Moja Global project focused on developing a high-throughput visualization pipeline on Google Earth Engine! Moja Global specializes in software for monitoring greenhouse gas emissions and removals from land use and land use change. Our project aims to enhance the performance and utility of visualization workflows for extensive model outputs generated by FLINT (Flexible Land Inventory and Reporting Tool).

## Project Overview

The outputs of FLINT are spatially explicit and often used to model carbon flux over vast areas, ranging from millions to billions of spatial units. Remote sensing data, such as Landsat imagery, is commonly used for these models at a 30-meter resolution. However, handling truly massive simulation results poses challenges in terms of performance and scalability.

The Generic Carbon Budget Model, implemented on FLINT, reports carbon stocks and fluxes for various carbon pools relevant to the AFOLU (Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use) sector. These simulations, conducted over tens or hundreds of years at high resolution, result in simulation output databases of hundreds of gigabytes.

## Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to develop a new approach to post-processing simulation output databases to improve the performance and throughput of IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change)-compliant reporting guidelines. Key objectives include:

- Summarizing and aggregating simulation output databases by administrative land units (e.g., property, county, or state boundaries) efficiently.
- Enhancing communication and collaboration with stakeholders from Moja Global and Natural Resources Canada (NRCan).
- Demonstrating creativity in proposing new solutions to address performance challenges in post-processing workflows.
- Evaluating algorithmic complexity and selecting optimal approaches and algorithms for high-throughput visualization.

## Eager to Learn and Contribute
